# fuzzy-pancake
A simple and minimalist online game using HTML5 WebSockets. 
The aim of this school project is to use the WebSockets in a client/server application (using NodeJS) in order to develop a "Stock Car" game

## How to run ?
Start the server part using the command 
```
$ node assets/js/server.js
```
This will start a NodeJS Web Sockets server listening on port ```1099```

You can now access the game using your favorite web server and the ``index.html``` page.

## Usage

You can use a gamepad (warning: key bindings can be different between two gamepads...) or your keyboard arrows.
